.bst files for scientific journals

This repository will be updated with any .bst BibTex style files that I have generated using makebst. Any style files are free to use, but I do not claim that they perfectly match journal specifications. Some files may be a work in progress and as such you should vet them thouroughly during use.

Beneficial edits and contributions to any of the files are welcome!
